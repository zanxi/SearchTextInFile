# find
My program finds pattern from a text using threads. I need to create a dynamic array the size of the input file, fill the dynamic array with the information in the file, create a thread for every search pattern in the command line. Parent should start all of the threads. Each thread will search for their own search pattern in the array. Each thread should keep a count of the number of occurrences of their search pattern that are found in the array. The parent should wait for each thread to complete.  Once each thread has terminated the parent can print the findings from each thread.
